<p>This application parses the Legend File produced by a Dwarf Fortress game before you start the game. It can be a considerable size with a medium sized game being a couple of hundred megabytes in size. This XML is difficult to read. This tool parses the information and turns it into a searchable database.</p>
<p>It is currently hosted on CloudFoundry. As the XML file is large it is not run in real time but using Resque/.Redis which means the file can be parsed not in real time. Also as the Worker Instance (which parses the file) is a different application than the Server app and Cloudfoundry does not allow shared files, the file is uploads then synced across on Dropbox. This can mean 10 minutes or so for a large file to upload.</p>
<p>I would probably do the parsing by email if I was to extend this.</p>
<p>You can view the login and see what goes on within the application at</p>
<p>dwarfquery.cloudfoundry.com</p>
<p>Use the test user : testuser@gmail.com. password is:sammy1</p>
<p>Using this test user you and search and view the data.</p>
<p>This application makes use of alot of gems within Rails including the composite_key, dropbox sdk, resque and of course cloudfoundry.</p>
<p>Including some screenshots below. Historical Figures, Entities they are linked to and Historical Events. There is more related informaton if you browse round</p>
