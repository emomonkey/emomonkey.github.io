	   <p>Now that my web site has been live for a couple of months I have had time to go back and see some improvements I can make. The first thing I noticed was regarding the Highchart graphs, I noticed that you could filter out the lines of the graph that you where not interested in by clicking on the related legend. So I updated the graph so that clicking on it does not move you to a new page which meant this useful dynamic legend filter functionality could be used. You can still move pages by clicking on the left hand side grid boxes</p>
<p><img src="/assets/screenshot-from-2015-03-03-214817.png" alt="High Charts Graphs" width="600" height="310" /></p>
<p>The second thing I noticed was that smaller towns ended up with the highest price. This was due to the low volumes of sales in the area. This meant a single site valued at 600,000 pounds would give high average price as it was the only one available. I do need some sorted of weighted average. Any suggestions would be welcome.</p>

	   <p>Using Highcharts is straightforward enough using the ruby on rails gem as you can see on my web site <a href="http://www.propertytrackerni.co.uk">http://www.propertytrackerni.co.uk</a> thanks to the gem lazy_high_charts. However what do we need to do is to use these graphing tool in a scheduled email ?</p>
<p>The answer is that we need a scheduled job to call this browser based javascript graphing tool from the command line and we need this scheduled routine to first export the graphing info out to json.</p>
<p>To export this data in json take a look at the below code</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><p>volcnty = @graphservice.fndavgprcmthyr<br />
cats = {:categories =&gt; volcnty.category}<br />
icnt = 0<br />
vdata = Array.new<br />
volcnty.series.each do |volitm|<br />
vdata &lt;&lt; Hash(:name =&gt; volcnty.arrseries[icnt], :data =&gt; volitm)<br />
icnt+=1<br />
end<br />
types = {:type =&gt; "line"}<br />
yax = {:title =&gt; {:text =&gt; "Average Asking Price"}}<br />
graphdat = {:chart =&gt; types,:title =&gt; "Average Asking Price over the year",:xAxis =&gt; cats,:yAxis =&gt; yax, :series =&gt; vdata}<br />
File.open("#{Rails.root}/highchart/exporting-server/phantomjs/#{@currtrans.id}__avgyr.json", "w") { |f| f.write(graphdat.to_json) }</p></pre></div>
<p>The routine @graphservice.fndavgprcmthyr calls our postgres view and returns the result as an object which contains the results of our query, To write the data in a format highchart will understand we need to use the json put in the below format</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><p>graphdat = {:chart =&gt; types,:title =&gt; "Average Asking Price over the year",:xAxis =&gt; cats,:yAxis =&gt; yax, :series =&gt; vdata}</p></pre></div>
<p>A shell script needs to be called to call highcharts and convery the json into a png which can be loaded into our email</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><p>system(<span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>sh <span class="pl-pse">#{</span><span class="pl-s2"><span class="pl-s3">Rails</span>.root</span><span class="pl-pse"><span class="pl-s2">}</span></span>/highchart/exporting-server/phantomjs/phantomjs.sh <span class="pl-pse">#{</span><span class="pl-s2"><span class="pl-s3">Rails</span>.root</span><span class="pl-pse"><span class="pl-s2">}</span></span> <span class="pl-pse">#{</span><span class="pl-s2"><span class="pl-vo">@currtrans</span>.id</span><span class="pl-pse"><span class="pl-s2">}</span></span>__volyr_<span class="pl-pse">#{</span><span class="pl-s2">searchp.id</span><span class="pl-pse"><span class="pl-s2">}</span></span>.json volyr_<span class="pl-pse">#{</span><span class="pl-s2">searchp.id</span><span class="pl-pse"><span class="pl-s2">}</span></span>_<span class="pl-pse">#{</span><span class="pl-s2"><span class="pl-vo">@currtrans</span>.id</span><span class="pl-pse"><span class="pl-s2">}</span></span>.png<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)</p></pre></div>
<p>This shell script contains the below code</p>

	    <a href="/programming/2015/02/11/effective-use-of-concurrent-sidekiq-workers/">Effective Use of Concurrent Sidekiq Workers</a>
	  </h1>
	  <p class = "author">
	    <span class="date">2015-02-11 22:17:41 +0000</span>
	  </p>
	  <div class="content">
	   <p>One of the benefits of Sidekiq is that it allows your application to work on a single task using simultaneous worker processes which also  means that you have a set of additional problems</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure separate workers do not save the same record result at the same causing data duplication</li>
<li>Ensure separate workers do not work on the same data</li>
</ul>
<p>Sidekiq has proved useful on my web scraping code for my Northern Ireland Property Web Site at <a href="http://www.propertytrackerni.co.uk/">http://www.propertytrackerni.co.uk</a></p>
<p>Obviously neither of these issues is something that you would want to happen in your working application and the issue if data duplication can be easily resolved by adding unique database constraints so that the same data cannot be added to your database table.</p>
<p>The second issue can be resolved by marking off data that has been processed already which I have achieved by adding the below line to the code</p>
<blockquote><p>  if pdate == nil or (pdate.year &lt;= Time.now.year and pdate.mon != Time.now.month)</p></blockquote>
<p>This pdate contains the date the search area record was last processed and as this task is monthly this means search areas that have already been processed will be passed over. Now this does mean that later workers will have to iterate over search params that have already been processed but as the number of search areas can be measured in the thousands (Northern Ireland is quote small) this is not much overhead. The WHERE ActiveRecord statement could be used on top of the top condition e.g.</p>
<blockquote><p>SearchParams.where(“searchdate is null or (EXTRACT(YEAR FROM searchdate) &lt;= EXTRACT(YEAR FROM now()) AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM searchdate) &lt;= EXTRACT(MONTH FROM now()))find_each(start:isize, batch_size: batchsize)</p></blockquote>
<p>However as find_each retrieves data in batches it is possible another worker could have retrieved one of your batches and it is now processed so the if condition is needed as well as the database constraint. The database constraint is needed as it is possible that the more than one worker could have grabbed the row before a database update has been done.</p>
<p>I would be interested in hearing about better methods that could be used to achieve this using SideKiq and Ruby. For example can I specify the number of workers dynamically and then calculate how the records to be processed are split among the workers. This does not seem the case in sidekiq.yml. I know I can specify the maximum number of workers but that is it</p>
<blockquote><p>:verbose: false<br />
:pidfile: ./tmp/pids/sidekiq.pid<br />
:logfile: ./log/sidekiq.log<br />
:concurrency: 25<br />
:queues:<br />
- default<br />
- queue_analysis<br />
- queue_scraper<br />
:limits:<br />
queue_analysis: 1<br />
queue_scraper: 15</p></blockquote>
<p>The code is below</p>
<blockquote><p>class ParseResultsWorker</p>
<p>include Sidekiq::Worker</p>
<p>sidekiq_options :queue =&gt; :queue_scraper</p>
<p>def perform(*args)<br />
isize = 1<br />
batchsize = 10000<br />
stime = Time.now<br />
vst = stime.strftime("%H:%M:%S");<br />
tstat = Transstatus.find_by name: 'ParseResultsWorker', created_at: Time.now.utc.to_date<br />
if tstat.nil?<br />
tstat = Transstatus.create(:name =&gt; "ParseResultsWorker" )<br />
end<br />
Rails.logger.debug ' ParseResultsWorker start job ' + vst<br />
SearchParams.find_each(start:isize, batch_size: batchsize) do |params|<br />
pdate = params['searchdate']<br />
if pdate == nil or (pdate.year &lt;= Time.now.year and pdate.mon != Time.now.month)<br />
tstat.update(currentparam: params.searchparam)<br />
@pnewscrawl = PropertyNewsCrawler.new('http://www.propertynews.com', params.searchparam)<br />
@pnewscrawl.findresult<br />
end<br />
end<br />
etime = Time.now<br />
vet = etime.strftime("%H:%M:%S");<br />
PropertySite.lastscanned<br />
Rails.logger.debug ' ParseResultsWorker end job ' + vet<br />
rescue StandardError =&gt; e<br />
Rails.logger.debug 'Error running ParseResultsWorker.perform ' + e.message<br />
return false;<br />

	  <div class="content">
	   <p>Having taken a look at my Property Tracking Web Site for  Northern Ireland<a href="http://www.propertytrackerni.co.uk"> http://www.propertytrackerni.co.uk</a> over several months I have noticed that the lack of weightings does throw up some distracting results. For example Lack in Co. Fermanagh has become one the areas with the highest average prices simply due to the fact it has one property that is over 500,000 in value and this property happens to be a site.</p>
<p>Now I do categorize properties as detached, semi- detached, sites etc so I could pull sites out but that would defeat the purpose. It does illustrate that weightings are pretty essential when carrying out this sort of analysis.</p>
<p>One thing that I am happy with is the use of<a href="http://refills.bourbon.io/"> http://refills.bourbon.io/</a> as the display technology. Using this I have immediately could a website that looks professional and can be used to automatically generate templates for the pages within the application. It is alot more lightweight than Bootstrap and having viewed my website on my mobile seems to give a basic level of responsive design to the site straight out of the box. I am somewhat surprised that Bootstrap seems to be used to such a large extent when you get so much for free using Bourbon Refills. It reminds me a little bit of the automatic screens in Oracle Apex<a href="https://apex.oracle.com/i/"> https://apex.oracle.com/i/</a> only you are not limited to the Oracle concept of using Pl/SQL everywhere. In ThoughtBot's Bourbon you also have lot of controls that have an iOS feel as well.</p>
<p>So in terms of the look of the site I am pretty happy. In terms of maintaining this site, well I have found web scraping apps will always require some work. My source site made some changes to their site in December and this resulted in some changes needing to be made to my interface code. This is something that could not be improved unless I abandoned the idea of pulling data from another site and used a public domain dataset.</p>
