          <p>The Northern Ireland Property Tracking website has been running for well over a year and  a half now so I have put together a like for like comparison of price changes for the month of March 2016 and the month of March 2015. It has left us with some interesting difference for Northern Ireland as a whole and individual areas. I have focused on some specific areas such as Portadown and Banbridge as examples and you can use  http://www.propertytrackerni.co.uk to track your local town as well.
For starters Detached houses on average are coming in at  221,544 for Northern Ireland as a whole in March 2016 which compares to an average price of 219,458 in March 2015 an increase of 0.95 percent. Portadown has average prices for Detached houses coming in at 137,313 in March 2016 while in March 2015 the average price was 196,681 a decrease of 30.2 percent. This is quite a decrease and alot of it comes down to volume of houses on the market. In  February 2015 we have just 24 detaches houses on the market for sale in Portadown while in March 2016 we have 32 houses for sale.

If you take a look the graph below which lists the volumn of detached houses on sale which is the bottom graph and the sale price which is the top bar chart you will see that th average asking price for a detached house struggled to beat 150000 while there was a large volume of property on sale through May, June and July of 2015. Each of these months had over 40 to over 50 houses up for sale.

It does seem to be a buyers market in Portadown at the moment for detached houses.
The next market to take a look at is semi detached houses in portadown which will allow us to see if there is more demand for one type of house compared to another.
<img src="http://emomonkey.github.io/images/Screenshot%20semi%20portadown1.png" alt="Portadown Volume 1 Semi">
One thing that can be seen is quite clearly the price of semi detached house has tumbled in Portadown. In March 2016 the aveage asking price for a semi detached house is just 85000 compared to 103,415 in March 2015 a drop of near 18 percent
<img src="http://emomonkey.github.io/images/Screenshot%20semi%20portadown%202.png" alt="Portadown Volume 2 Semi">
This volatility in price could be down to the small number of semi detached houses that go on sale in portadown. The semi detached houses are coloured in orange and there are seldom less than 5 new semi detached houses up for sale in a month excluded June. Still the price drop is not encouraging to people who bought a semi detached the past year in Portadown. Still worse if they bought it Pre-2000

<p>It doesn&#39;t seem to be universal though as there does seem a steady climb in prices in Banbridge though supply is growing there prices have yet to drop

<p>Apartments on the other hand average in at 122,294 for March 2016  and in March 2015 came in at 120,738 which is a 1.3 percent increase overall in Northern Ireland

It does support the idea that people are more prepared to live in rental apartments and is worth looking into more...in next months post or you can investiage yourself at <a href="http://www.propertytrackerni.co.uk">PropertyTrackerNI</a></p>
