	   <p>I have put together an application that is provides a web front end to either a USB WebCam or Raspberry PI Cam. The application can be set to random mode and alarm mode. In order to use alarm mode and infra red sensor (PIR) should be connected to GPIO17. If movement is detected an image is taken and an email of the image is sent.</p>
<p>If the application is in random mode, random shots are taken throughout the day, you can define the start time and end time so no shots are taken outside the time, you can also define the frequency. Comments can also be added to the images. The layout of the screen is shown in github</p>
<p>The idea with the random feature is that you get a journal of your photos. These photos can also be emailed out. The logs of detection from the PIR sensor are also displayed on the screen.</p>
<p>This means that as well as using my Raspberry PI as a Youtube player attached to the TV it can also serve as an alarm system and photo journal.</p>

<p>The code can be found at <a title="https://github.com/emomonkey/RaspPISpyIntranet" href="https://github.com/emomonkey/RaspPISpyIntranet">https://github.com/emomonkey/RaspPISpyIntranet</a></p>
<p>In theory you should be able to install by running sudo python setup.py install. However I have not tested the install, it would require a spare Sdcard so I would be interested in feedback from the forum if the install runs.</p>
<p>Also you need to run the shell script gpioexp.sh in order that the pins can be written to</p>
<p>An alternative way to install it is from the github page which is the the long way and involves copying the files to RaspPISpyIntranet and install the python packages individuals.</p>
<p>The application needs to be run as sudo as the pins need supervisor access.</p>
<p>So now the PI in my living room doubles as an email alarm and photo journal in addition to a PC</p>

<p>Well I have worked through quite a few of the demos on the gertboard manual so I thought I'd spend some time combining the demos and rather than just have a motor going or a led lighting up I duct taped a nerf gun to the servo and as you can see from the demo it does fire.</p>
<p>Alex eames from raspi tv give some help on wiring it together, as well the sketches in the arduino ide mention pin 9 and using the gertboard you have to use the buffers so you set up buffer 1 as pin 9.</p>
<p>To wire it up you do the following : PB1 to B1 on J3 and servo pulse to BUF1 near the leds. Jumper B1 set to output.<br />
GND lead of servo to Gertboard GND and 5V servo lead to 5V supply. GND of 5V supply also to Gertboard GND.<br />
<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=42&amp;t=37624"> raspberryorg</a></p>
<p>You jumper off the output as PB1 will provide the input to Buf 1. You then wire the control cable [orange on the servo] to Buf 1. The ground cable from the servo goes in the ground of PB1 and the positive servo cable to the positive battery. I ground the battery cable to the ground on PB1.It does not seem to matter where it is ground goes</p>
<p>Minicom has been set up on the raspberry pi so GP14 and GP15 had jumpers set across to MCTX and RCTX as can be seen in the video. All that needs done to read the data from minicom (serial comms) is the function call Serial.Read</p>
<p>The code from the arduino ide is listed below</p>
<blockquote><p>// Serial Servo Nerf</p>
<p>#include &lt;Servo.h&gt;</p>
<p>Servo myservo; // create servo object<br />
byte num = 0; // read in serial input<br />
int pos = 0;<br />
int servo_enabled = 0;</p>
<p>void setup() {<br />
// initialize serial port<br />
Serial.begin(9600);<br />
myservo.attach(9); // attaches the servo on pin 9<br />
}</p>
<p>void loop()<br />
{<br />
// pressing the letter a fires the servo<br />
num = Serial.read();</p>
<p>if (num == 97 &amp;&amp; servo_enabled == 0)<br />
{<br />
servo_enabled = 1;<br />
Serial.print("arming nerf");<br />
Serial.print("character received: ");<br />
Serial.println(num, DEC);<br />
delay(1); // required to read serial buffer<br />
}<br />
}</p>
<p>if (servo_enabled ==  1 )<br />
{</p>
<p>for(pos = 0; pos &lt; 100; pos +=1)<br />
{    myservo.write(pos);<br />
delay(15); // waaaaaits 15 ms for the servo to reach position<br />
}</p>
<p>// move back<br />
for(pos =  100; pos &gt;=1 ; pos-=1) // goes aaback to the position<br />
{<br />
myservo.write(pos);<br />
delay(15);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>Serial.print("servo disengaged");<br />
servo_enabled = 0;<br />
}</p>
<p>}</p></blockquote>

	   <p>Well I have been running through the test programs for my gertboard and they all seem straightforward. There are a few snags you can hit even using the manual.</p>
<p>The manual has lots of wiring diagrams but it does not clearly explain you need to put the 3V jumper on to fully enable the buttons and leds. Secondly for the motor test it does not fully explain the type of external power source you need. I initially had a 2 AA battery pack as used on the adafruit example. This did not produce enough voltage to power the motor through the gertboard (it did power when the battery was hooked direct to the 3V motor) A 9V PP3 battery is required to power the 3V motor on the motor test program.</p>

	  </p>
	  <div class="content">
	   <p>I have been working on an ASP.Net MVC EF Application that allows you to explore, query and analyse that Item and Gem Data in the TorchLight 2 Game. I thought it would be an interesting project that would allow me to compare ASP.Net MVC with Ruby on Rails and more importantly Oracle Applications Express 4.1, a tool that I use reasonably often at work.</p>
<p>I have to admit I have found ASP.Net in the past not that interesting especially compared to classic ASP, the whole Web Forms concept seemed to be too custom and too dependent on clicking in controls, seemed too ActiveX or VB6.</p>
<p>ASP.Net MVC does give you complete control of the code, you can use many open source controls and the Microsoft specific HTML helpers are generally useful although the Ajax Helpers are a bit too restrictive you are far better just writing it yourself in Javascript at least that way you can debug it. The Entity Framework does a good job of replicating Ruby on Rails ActiveRecord Framework although I found defining the relationships through the Model a bit awkward, it's simply an annotation in Ruby on Rails. Now as I have an existing database (I had to pull the Item/Gem data out of Torchlight 2 I  could not use the Code First Method) so that may be one reason but again it was easy to use Ruby on Rails annotation to define how things are mapped.</p>
<p>Saying that Visual Studio Express 2012 is much nicer than the gedit environment I used on my netbook for Ruby on Rails. Git Integration is nice however I could not use it well with AppHarbour, in fact Git Integration in the Express version seems quite awkward, how you rollback from within Visual Studio seemed impossible</p>
<p>I used the Windows 8 Github add on and that worked seemlessly with AppHarbor and AppHarbor is free unlike Azure which is free for 3 months. Should have realised that going the way Microsoft charges you even to play online with XBox ;). Also another nice think with AppHarbor, once I had my connections set up I could easily copy my databases across though that might be to do with Sql Server Management tools.</p>
<p>So my Torchlight 2 Application, what does it consist of. Well firstly the home screen.</p>
<p><img id="i-78" alt="Image" src="/assets/home.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see it is all fairly standard from here you can explore the search for specific items/weapns, there is also a couple of Wizards which advise use the best use of a gem and the best use of the weapons.</p>
<p>You can also Explore through the Item Database</p>
<p>Below is a screenshot of searching through the Item database</p>
<p><img id="i-83" alt="Image" src="/assets/search.png" /></p>
<p>Below is a screen of the Gem Wizard where it give advice on their best use.</p>
<p><img id="i-85" alt="Image" src="/assets/wizard.png" /></p>
<p>Below is a screen of the Item Detail Screen</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-55" alt="details" src="/assets/details.jpg" width="300" height="217" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below is a screen of the Best Weapon Use Screen</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-56" alt="bestweap" src="/assets/bestweap.jpg" width="300" height="217" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Screen of the Explore Items Screen</p>
<p><img id="i-90" alt="Image" src="/assets/explore.png" /></p>
<p>There are quite a few screens, they all make use of Partial Paging, Ajax and the Entity Framework, You do not have to log into the application except if you want to add Items to the basket. I have not done anymore with this and probably won't, I have a raspberry pi and gertboard to play with.</p>
<p>Do feel like doing a post comparing ASP.Net MVC with Oracle Applications Express 4.1, comparing Models, Views, Controllers, ModelViews and separating out database code into separate classes is kindof hard to do in Apex but there are ways of structuring code in Apex. And I will find it interesting thinking about how my Apex code has been formally structured (packages, functions, Apex API and of course that front end).</p>
