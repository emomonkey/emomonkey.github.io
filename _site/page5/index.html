	   <p>I have been working on an ASP.Net MVC EF Application that allows you to explore, query and analyse that Item and Gem Data in the TorchLight 2 Game. I thought it would be an interesting project that would allow me to compare ASP.Net MVC with Ruby on Rails and more importantly Oracle Applications Express 4.1, a tool that I use reasonably often at work.</p>
<p>I have to admit I have found ASP.Net in the past not that interesting especially compared to classic ASP, the whole Web Forms concept seemed to be too custom and too dependent on clicking in controls, seemed too ActiveX or VB6.</p>
<p>ASP.Net MVC does give you complete control of the code, you can use many open source controls and the Microsoft specific HTML helpers are generally useful although the Ajax Helpers are a bit too restrictive you are far better just writing it yourself in Javascript at least that way you can debug it. The Entity Framework does a good job of replicating Ruby on Rails ActiveRecord Framework although I found defining the relationships through the Model a bit awkward, it's simply an annotation in Ruby on Rails. Now as I have an existing database (I had to pull the Item/Gem data out of Torchlight 2 I  could not use the Code First Method) so that may be one reason but again it was easy to use Ruby on Rails annotation to define how things are mapped.</p>
<p>Saying that Visual Studio Express 2012 is much nicer than the gedit environment I used on my netbook for Ruby on Rails. Git Integration is nice however I could not use it well with AppHarbour, in fact Git Integration in the Express version seems quite awkward, how you rollback from within Visual Studio seemed impossible</p>
<p>I used the Windows 8 Github add on and that worked seemlessly with AppHarbor and AppHarbor is free unlike Azure which is free for 3 months. Should have realised that going the way Microsoft charges you even to play online with XBox ;). Also another nice think with AppHarbor, once I had my connections set up I could easily copy my databases across though that might be to do with Sql Server Management tools.</p>
<p>So my Torchlight 2 Application, what does it consist of. Well firstly the home screen.</p>
<p><img id="i-78" alt="Image" src="/assets/home.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see it is all fairly standard from here you can explore the search for specific items/weapns, there is also a couple of Wizards which advise use the best use of a gem and the best use of the weapons.</p>
<p>You can also Explore through the Item Database</p>
<p>Below is a screenshot of searching through the Item database</p>
<p><img id="i-83" alt="Image" src="/assets/search.png" /></p>
<p>Below is a screen of the Gem Wizard where it give advice on their best use.</p>
<p><img id="i-85" alt="Image" src="/assets/wizard.png" /></p>
<p>Below is a screen of the Item Detail Screen</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-55" alt="details" src="/assets/details.jpg" width="300" height="217" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below is a screen of the Best Weapon Use Screen</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Screen of the Explore Items Screen</p>
<p><img id="i-90" alt="Image" src="/assets/explore.png" /></p>
<p>There are quite a few screens, they all make use of Partial Paging, Ajax and the Entity Framework, You do not have to log into the application except if you want to add Items to the basket. I have not done anymore with this and probably won't, I have a raspberry pi and gertboard to play with.</p>
<p>Do feel like doing a post comparing ASP.Net MVC with Oracle Applications Express 4.1, comparing Models, Views, Controllers, ModelViews and separating out database code into separate classes is kindof hard to do in Apex but there are ways of structuring code in Apex. And I will find it interesting thinking about how my Apex code has been formally structured (packages, functions, Apex API and of course that front end).</p>

	   <p>I have been getting ready to deploy my TorchLight 2 ASP.Net MVC4 Application to Windows Azure but noticed even for a test instance it is not free for longer than 3 months. Making a deployment to that sight pretty meaningless. There is definitely an advantage to using Open Source Software if you are going to deploy something for fun and not fore profit.</p>
<p>ASP.NET MVC4 is a nice development environment, they have learned alot from Ruby on Rails so thing I will at least put some blog posts on my experience of using ASP.NET. Probably in comparison to Oracle Applications Express after all that is a significant part of my Day Job at times and like Microsoft , Oracle is not a Pro Open Source Software Provider</p>

	   <p>Surprised I did not see an example of this on the web but I noticed to use $.post to pass a value to an Action in your controller you need to JSON.stringify on the value to get it to post. Otherwise the value you get in your parameter will be null. See below</p>
<blockquote><p> $.post("/GemTable/ProcessBestGem",  { sGems: JSON.stringify(sname) }, function (html) {<br />
// Do Something;<br />
},"json");</p></blockquote>
<p>Useful to know maybe.</p>

	   <p>Well my ruby on rails application is up on Cloudfoundry at  dwarfquery.cloudfoundry.com. I have to admit I found cloudfoundry put a lot of limitations on your application. As this application had to parse very large XML files...maybe too large and Cloudfoundry does not allow you to share files I have to upload to temp and then upload to Dropbox. This was very awkward but necessary as the worker instance could not share files with the server instance. Also cloudfoundry forced me to use it's own instance of jquery.</p>
<p>Still there where some flaws with this concept of uploading 100's of megs of an XML file to be parsed but then again my project had to be ruby on rails as I was restricted to be netbook development environment.</p>
<p>Now however I have a Windows 8 laptop so new simple project is a MVVM application which calls the Diablo 3 Web API :) That and XCOM Enemy Unknown. Happy Christmas</p>
<p>As an update. I am using the MVVM template in Visual Studio Express 2012 for Web and I do think there is a bit more coding than MVC. The model has to be recreated twice, once in the C# server end and once in the JavaScript VM part of it. A lot of the template seems to assume I want my changes commited there and then however I do think database applications should have a standard commit button to give the user time to sanity check the updates before a commit. It could be that MVVM is only for certain applications i.e ones that need real time interaction. Still I want to use this technology so I will keep on with the MVVM template.</p>
<p>As for XCOM I cannot believe how hard the zombies are.........LMG's don't slow them down :(</p>
