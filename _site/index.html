	  <div class="content">
	   <p>The Northern Ireland Property Tracking website has been running for well over a year and  a half now so I have put together a like for like comparison of price changes for the month of March 2016 and the month of March 2015. It has left us with some interesting difference for Northern Ireland as a whole and individual areas. I have focused on some specific areas such as Portadown and Banbridge as examples and you can use  http://www.propertytrackerni.co.uk to track your local town as well.
For starters Detached houses on average are coming in at  221,544 for Northern Ireland as a whole in March 2016 which compares to an average price of 219,458 in March 2015 an increase of 0.95 percent. Portadown has average prices for Detached houses coming in at 137,313 in March 2016 while in March 2015 the average price was 196,681 a decrease of 30.2 percent. This is quite a decrease and alot of it comes down to volume of houses on the market. In  February 2015 we have just 24 detaches houses on the market for sale in Portadown while in March 2016 we have 32 houses for sale.

<img src="http://emomonkey.github.io/images/Screenshot portadownvolume detach.png" alt="Portadown Volume 1" />
If you take a look the graph below which lists the volumn of detached houses on sale which is the bottom graph and the sale price which is the top bar chart you will see that th average asking price for a detached house struggled to beat 150000 while there was a large volume of property on sale through May, June and July of 2015. Each of these months had over 40 to over 50 houses up for sale.
<img src="http://emomonkey.github.io/images/Screenshot portadown volume2.png" alt="Portadown Volume 2" />
It does seem to be a buyers market in Portadown at the moment for detached houses.
The next market to take a look at is semi detached houses in portadown which will allow us to see if there is more demand for one type of house compared to another.
<img src="http://emomonkey.github.io/images/Screenshot semi portadown1.png" alt="Portadown Volume 1 Semi" />
One thing that can be seen is quite clearly the price of semi detached house has tumbled in Portadown. In March 2016 the aveage asking price for a semi detached house is just 85000 compared to 103,415 in March 2015 a drop of near 18 percent
<img src="http://emomonkey.github.io/images/Screenshot semi portadown 2.png" alt="Portadown Volume 2 Semi" />
This volatility in price could be down to the small number of semi detached houses that go on sale in portadown. The semi detached houses are coloured in orange and there are seldom less than 5 new semi detached houses up for sale in a month excluded June. Still the price drop is not encouraging to people who bought a semi detached the past year in Portadown. Still worse if they bought it Pre-2000

<p>It doesn’t seem to be universal though as there does seem a steady climb in prices in Banbridge though supply is growing there prices have yet to drop

<p>Apartments on the other hand average in at 122,294 for March 2016  and in March 2015 came in at 120,738 which is a 1.3 percent increase overall in Northern Ireland

It does support the idea that people are more prepared to live in rental apartments and is worth looking into more…in next months post or you can investiage yourself at http://www.propertytrackerni.co.uk</p>

	    <a href="/2015/12/09/IsaacSpectrum/">Is Binding of Isaac a Remake of Atic Atac ?</a>
	  </h1>

	  </p>
	  <div class="content">
	   <p>I have been playing alot of Binding of Isaac since it became available on Linux, it is now my goto 30 minute game but one thing that stuck me was how it felt like a game I had played before right down to the gothic dungeons and caverns. It took a while to figure it out and it looks like I am not the only one having searched the web and I finally remembered a game I had on my Sinclair Spectrum. It was Atic Atac by Ultimate now none as Rare.
<img src="http://emomonkey.github.io/images/atic3.png" alt="Atic Atac" /></p>

<p>However back then there was no twin stick gaming, you had to lock your fire in a certain direction and then you could move around in another direction. However all games back then are what would be called a collectors edition as you usually got a large box and a lovely well illustrated booklet.
<img src="http://emomonkey.github.io/images/case.png" alt="Atic Atac Case" /></p>

<p>Binding of Isaac rooms do seem so far more rectangular in nature, I have not seen rooms in different sizes or in different shapes such as caverns. But take a look below and see if you can see some visual similarity.</p>

<p><img src="http://emomonkey.github.io/images/isaac.jpg" alt="Binding of Isaac" /></p>

<p>And going down that track looking at Super Meat Boy does anyone thing there is a certain similarity to a certain game by Matthew Smith ;). I have thought about going through a Spectrum collection to look for some inspiration for a Gamemaker title though its not as easy as you think. It does seem to take a certain amount of talent to find the correct title and update it in a hip and current way. </p>

<p>Take the below selection of games
 * Tir Na Nog
 * Lords of Midnight
 * UnderWurlde
 * Pyjamarama</p>

<p>Most of these games nowadays seem rather slow, UnderWurlde does seem similar to Spelunky with its ropes, platforming and water areas but the other games definitely would to too slow for todays audience.</p>

<p><img src="http://emomonkey.github.io/images/Underwurlde1.jpg" alt="Underwurlde" /></p>

<p>Spelunky is a bit more busy and as you can see it has multiplayer functionality which you would not get in the pre internet days.</p>

<p><img src="http://emomonkey.github.io/images/spelunky.jpg" alt="Spelunky" /></p>

<p>It does make me wonder if there aren’t some more missing gems hidden in the Sinclair Spectrum vault. Some genres have disappeared such as straightforward maze games like Sabrewulf and Ant Attack. I can see the Meat Boy team doing a high paced Maze game or maybe Vlambeer can do a new Lunar Jetman spin …. maybe something like Lufthasers…</p>

<p>Maybe it’s time to brush off Gamemaker and seek some Sinclair Inspiration</p>

	   <p>The Latest updates to the the Property Tracker Northern Ireland application have been put live and these changes allow you to check the price of a property in an area you select and the type of property you want to see.</p>

<p>Basically you enter the below information
 * Property Type for example Semi, Detached
 * No of Bedrooms
 * Postcode
 * Street Name or Housing Development</p>

<p>On clicking submit the average price for the above type of property will be found.</p>

<p><img src="http://emomonkey.github.io/assets/Screenshotsearch.png" alt="Search Screenshot" /></p>

<p>My initial thoughts where to add this screen as a mobile application and create a JSON API from the rails application to connect to it but matching this against a rails approach which can be accomplished in a matter of hours this seemed a much easier approach. The Property Tracker Northern Ireland application can be found at the following URL <a href="http://www.propertytrackerni.co.uk">http://www.propertytrackerni.co.uk</a></p>

	  </h1>

	  </p>
	  <div class="content">
	   <p>Well I have been playing with my Syma X5C Quad Copter for over a month now and it is still going strong even though it has been dropped straight out of the sky by shutting down the rotors so it doesnt blow into the farmers fields close by. I have been using it under the pretence of teaching my 4 year old son how to fly it which explains the short flights in the youtube video below. However given that is so light means that we can let it fall once it gets out of eyesight though I am flying over long grass as you can see below. The downside of being light is that a heavy gust of wind will blow it out of eyesight if you get it real high and believe me it does fly very high. Then it is best to drop it out of the sky while you can still see it.</p>

<p>I was surprised that there was audio as well on the device as I don’y think you will be interested in recording what someone is saying unless you intend to land it in someone’s house and do some 007 spying. I am lucky to have a building site behind our house which gives plenty of space to fly it. I havent needed to change the rotors or anything though after one steep fall I had to recailbrate it by putti The setting it on the ground flat in the house and moving both joysticks to the bottom right until the lights flashed and then stopped. This rebalanced the rotors.</p>

<p>I would recommend this Quad Copter the Syma  X5C as it is about 35 pounds of amazon for a capable quad copter with HD video and audio. It can take stills as well by down pressing the left button on the remote control.</p>
