	   <p>I have been playing alot of Binding of Isaac since it became available on Linux, it is now my goto 30 minute game but one thing that stuck me was how it felt like a game I had played before right down to the gothic dungeons and caverns. It took a while to figure it out and it looks like I am not the only one having searched the web and I finally remembered a game I had on my Sinclair Spectrum. It was Atic Atac by Ultimate now none as Rare.

<p>However back then there was no twin stick gaming, you had to lock your fire in a certain direction and then you could move around in another direction. However all games back then are what would be called a collectors edition as you usually got a large box and a lovely well illustrated booklet.

<p>Binding of Isaac rooms do seem so far more rectangular in nature, I have not seen rooms in different sizes or in different shapes such as caverns. But take a look below and see if you can see some visual similarity.</p>

<p><img src="http://emomonkey.github.io/images/isaac.jpg" alt="Binding of Isaac" /></p>

<p>And going down that track looking at Super Meat Boy does anyone thing there is a certain similarity to a certain game by Matthew Smith ;). I have thought about going through a Spectrum collection to look for some inspiration for a Gamemaker title though its not as easy as you think. It does seem to take a certain amount of talent to find the correct title and update it in a hip and current way. </p>

<p>Take the below selection of games
 * Tir Na Nog
 * Lords of Midnight
 * UnderWurlde
 * Pyjamarama</p>

<p>Most of these games nowadays seem rather slow, UnderWurlde does seem similar to Spelunky with its ropes, platforming and water areas but the other games definitely did not work.</p>

<p>Basically you enter the below information

<p>My initial thoughts where to add this screen as a mobile application and create a JSON API from the rails application to connect to it but matching this against a rails approach which can be accomplished in a matter of hours this seemed a much easier approach.

	   <p>Well I have been playing with my Syma X5C Quad Copter for over a month now and it is still going strong even though it has been dropped straight out of the sky by shutting down the rotors so it doesnt blow into the farmers fields close by. I have been using it under the pretence of teaching my 4 year old son how to fly it which explains the short flights in the youtube video below. However given that is so light means that we can let it fall once it gets out of eyesight though I am flying over long grass as you can see below. The downside of being light is that a heavy gust of wind will blow it out of eyesight if you get it real high and believe me it does fly very high. Then it is best to drop it out of the sky while you can still see it.</p>

<p>I was surprised that there was audio as well on the device as I don’y think you will be interested in recording what someone is saying unless you intend to land it in someone’s house and do some 007 spying. I am lucky to have a building site behind our house which gives plenty of space to fly it. I havent needed to change the rotors or anything though after one steep fall I had to recailbrate it by putti The setting it on the ground flat in the house and moving both joysticks to the bottom right until the lights flashed and then stopped. This rebalanced the rotors.</p>

<p>I would recommend this Quad Copter the Syma  X5C as it is about 35 pounds of amazon for a capable quad copter with HD video and audio. It can take stills as well by down pressing the left button on the remote control.</p>

	   <p>I recently had the need to develop a quick ruby on rails application offline, I had all the GEMS I needed for the application and ran bundle install –local and still I got errors. It seems with the latest versions of bundler local is not offline but requires an Internet connection. </p>

<p>To work offline in Ruby On Rails you need to run on bunder version 1.5.x and below. This is a bit of a gotcha for developers working in an offline environment.</p>
