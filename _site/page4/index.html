<p>This runs on the Krakenjs suite and runs on a Raspiberry PI with a PiGlow.The PiGlow glows according to the weather [blue is rain and orange is cloudy]</p>

	   <p>I have put together an application that is provides a web front end to either a USB WebCam or Raspberry PI Cam. The application can be set to random mode and alarm mode. In order to use alarm mode and infra red sensor (PIR) should be connected to GPIO17. If movement is detected an image is taken and an email of the image is sent.</p>
<p>If the application is in random mode, random shots are taken throughout the day, you can define the start time and end time so no shots are taken outside the time, you can also define the frequency. Comments can also be added to the images. The layout of the screen is shown in github</p>
<p>The idea with the random feature is that you get a journal of your photos. These photos can also be emailed out. The logs of detection from the PIR sensor are also displayed on the screen.</p>
<p>This means that as well as using my Raspberry PI as a Youtube player attached to the TV it can also serve as an alarm system and photo journal.</p>

<p>In theory you should be able to install by running sudo python setup.py install. However I have not tested the install, it would require a spare Sdcard so I would be interested in feedback from the forum if the install runs.</p>
<p>Also you need to run the shell script gpioexp.sh in order that the pins can be written to</p>
<p>An alternative way to install it is from the github page which is the the long way and involves copying the files to RaspPISpyIntranet and install the python packages individuals.</p>
<p>The application needs to be run as sudo as the pins need supervisor access.</p>
<p>So now the PI in my living room doubles as an email alarm and photo journal in addition to a PC</p>

<p>Well I have worked through quite a few of the demos on the gertboard manual so I thought I'd spend some time combining the demos and rather than just have a motor going or a led lighting up I duct taped a nerf gun to the servo and as you can see from the demo it does fire.</p>
<p>Alex eames from raspi tv give some help on wiring it together, as well the sketches in the arduino ide mention pin 9 and using the gertboard you have to use the buffers so you set up buffer 1 as pin 9.</p>
<p>To wire it up you do the following : PB1 to B1 on J3 and servo pulse to BUF1 near the leds. Jumper B1 set to output.<br />
GND lead of servo to Gertboard GND and 5V servo lead to 5V supply. GND of 5V supply also to Gertboard GND.<br />
<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=42&amp;t=37624"> raspberryorg</a></p>
<p>You jumper off the output as PB1 will provide the input to Buf 1. You then wire the control cable [orange on the servo] to Buf 1. The ground cable from the servo goes in the ground of PB1 and the positive servo cable to the positive battery. I ground the battery cable to the ground on PB1.It does not seem to matter where it is ground goes</p>
<p>Minicom has been set up on the raspberry pi so GP14 and GP15 had jumpers set across to MCTX and RCTX as can be seen in the video. All that needs done to read the data from minicom (serial comms) is the function call Serial.Read</p>
<p>The code from the arduino ide is listed below</p>
<blockquote><p>// Serial Servo Nerf</p>
<p>#include &lt;Servo.h&gt;</p>
<p>Servo myservo; // create servo object<br />
byte num = 0; // read in serial input<br />
int pos = 0;<br />
int servo_enabled = 0;</p>
<p>void setup() {<br />
// initialize serial port<br />
Serial.begin(9600);<br />
myservo.attach(9); // attaches the servo on pin 9<br />
}</p>
<p>void loop()<br />
{<br />
// pressing the letter a fires the servo<br />
num = Serial.read();</p>
<p>if (num == 97 &amp;&amp; servo_enabled == 0)<br />
{<br />
servo_enabled = 1;<br />
Serial.print("arming nerf");<br />
Serial.print("character received: ");<br />
Serial.println(num, DEC);<br />
delay(1); // required to read serial buffer<br />
}<br />
}</p>
<p>if (servo_enabled ==  1 )<br />
{</p>
<p>for(pos = 0; pos &lt; 100; pos +=1)<br />
{    myservo.write(pos);<br />
delay(15); // waaaaaits 15 ms for the servo to reach position<br />
}</p>
<p>// move back<br />
for(pos =  100; pos &gt;=1 ; pos-=1) // goes aaback to the position<br />
{<br />
myservo.write(pos);<br />
delay(15);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>Serial.print("servo disengaged");<br />
servo_enabled = 0;<br />
}</p>
<p>}</p></blockquote>

	   <p>Well I have been running through the test programs for my gertboard and they all seem straightforward. There are a few snags you can hit even using the manual.</p>
<p>The manual has lots of wiring diagrams but it does not clearly explain you need to put the 3V jumper on to fully enable the buttons and leds. Secondly for the motor test it does not fully explain the type of external power source you need. I initially had a 2 AA battery pack as used on the adafruit example. This did not produce enough voltage to power the motor through the gertboard (it did power when the battery was hooked direct to the 3V motor) A 9V PP3 battery is required to power the 3V motor on the motor test program.</p>
