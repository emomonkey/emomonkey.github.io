SpottyMail is now finally live and I am now in the process of advertising the site and hopefully expanding the service. SpottyMail should allow you to share your music so you can advertise your festival, concert or simply share your playlist with your friends. SpottyMail makes use of the 30 second preview API in Spotify so that the music can be shared on Twitter or via HTML Email. If you share via Twitter your tweet will include a link to a web page that is publicly available from the SpottyMail Web Server. If you share this via email the email will be forwarded to your own email address and from here you can share this to other users.

The Email and Web Page can be changed using an editor than can be used to change the fonts, colours, spacing, layout and images contained within the web page.

SpottyMail also includes a number of prebuilt templates so that you do not have to start from scratch and it will give you an idea of what the tool is capable of. I have also included a number of stock images which you can use as well as links to some other sites that allow you to use banners and images for your own public and personal use.

To ensure the HTML Emails can be viewed correctly no matter what email reader or browser is used an OpenSource Markup Framework MJML is used to reduce the amount of testing required to ensure your creation will be viewable by the recipients. MJML allows you to Banners, Headers, Table Layout and Text Fields which gives alot of freedom when creating your design. The Basic Spotify application does allow you to share you a preview of a track but this share is a basic link which is not suitable for producing a promotional email or advertisement. If you think this would be useful you can give Spotify a Trial and if you like it enough you can pay a small annual subscription. Spottymail is accessible from here <http://www.spottymail.co.uk>
