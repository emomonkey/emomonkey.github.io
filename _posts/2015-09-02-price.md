The Latest updates to the the Property Tracker Northern Ireland application have been put live and these changes allow you to check the price of a property in an area you select and the type of property you want to see.

Basically you enter the below information
 * Property Type for example Semi, Detached
 * No of Bedrooms
 * Postcode
 * Street Name or Housing Development

On clicking submit the average price for the above type of property will be found.

My initial thoughts where to add this screen as a mobile application and create a JSON API from the rails application to connect to it but matching this against a rails approach which can be accomplished in a matter of hours this seemed a much easier approach. The Property Tracker Northern Ireland application can be found at the following URL <http://www.propertytrackerni.co.uk>
