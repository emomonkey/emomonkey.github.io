<p>I am surprised how stable the Raspberry PI NodeJS server has proven to be. There is a constant stream of tweets being processed and counted on the MongoDB database and the system seems to stay up with little memory issues even though it is up for a week at a time. </p>
<p>Started moving forward with my next project. A MongoDB Spring data project running off the raspberry pi that stored beer recipes via an AngularJS front end. I also intend to hae it monitor the temperature of the beer and alert me when it is outside that range.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I know<a title="BrewPI" href="http://www.brewpi.com"> brewPI</a> exists but I would something non PHP. The twitter monitoring page is still up and running <a title="Whats up in waringstown" href="http://80.229.21.163/">http://80.229.21.163</a>/</p>
