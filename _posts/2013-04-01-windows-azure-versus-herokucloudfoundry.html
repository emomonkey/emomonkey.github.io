<p>I have been getting ready to deploy my TorchLight 2 ASP.Net MVC4 Application to Windows Azure but noticed even for a test instance it is not free for longer than 3 months. Making a deployment to that sight pretty meaningless. There is definitely an advantage to using Open Source Software if you are going to deploy something for fun and not fore profit.</p>
<p>ASP.NET MVC4 is a nice development environment, they have learned alot from Ruby on Rails so thing I will at least put some blog posts on my experience of using ASP.NET. Probably in comparison to Oracle Applications Express after all that is a significant part of my Day Job at times and like Microsoft , Oracle is not a Pro Open Source Software Provider</p>
