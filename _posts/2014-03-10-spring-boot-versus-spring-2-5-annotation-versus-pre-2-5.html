<p>One of the things I have found with Java is the multitude of frameworks. Working for an Oracle house company my Java exposure is ADF with some Vaadin work on the side. Now with half the world using Spring I have started work on a Rest Back End for my angular app. So it has been fun trying Spring Boot, Spring 2.5 with annotation and Pre Spring 2.5 and noticing how much work is being done to make Spring as easy to use as NodeJS, ASP and Ruby I guess. Spring 2.5 with annotations seems the best bet, Spring Boot makes way too many decisions for you so you don't understand the code you get. At least Spring annotation gets rid of alot of the nightmares encountered with the XML maze of early Java frameworks such as JDeveloper 10....</p>
