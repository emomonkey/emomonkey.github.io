Since SpottyMail went live I have been expanding the number of preset templates available in the application and noticed an Internet Meme going around where you "Share Your Playlist with your Crush". I am off that age where you recorded your compilation of music onto cassette whcih I think was immortalised in the Nick Hornby book and John Cusask movie High Fidelity. SpottyMail will help you make that Playlist a bit more personal rather than just a link to Spotify. There is a ready made template available

Spottymail is accessible from here <http://www.spottymail.co.uk> if you want to make your compilation that bit more special
