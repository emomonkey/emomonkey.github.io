<p>If you are struggling to write reusable pages in apex 4.1 with even simple things such as creating dynamic title page try this</p>
<p>1. Stores title in hid field.<br />
2. In title text put &amp;PX_XX. where the name matches the field in point 1</p>
<p>Seems a mishmash on what you should declare to use the value of a field e.g :PX_XX or P_XX or sometimes v('') but you can get reusable code done in apex to a certain extent. As long as u don't expect MVC levels :)</p>
<p>Padding parameters by URL is also a bit unusual. You have to list the parameters you are populating on the next page then separate this with a : and then the values u are inputing</p>
<p>E.g url = 'f?p=&amp;APP_ID.:4:&amp;APP_SESSION.::&amp;DEBUG.::P4_ID,P4_TRANSACTION:&amp;P15_ID.,EDIT'</p>
