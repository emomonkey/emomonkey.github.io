Well after over 2 years I have finally beaten Dark Souls. It has been a long cruel road that I have been working on even longer than my current Spotify/SoundCloud Web App and there has been the odd distraction including a few months on Grand Theft Auto but now Dark Souls is beaten. It is a varied game through Swamp , Dungeons, Forests, Fairy Land and Beyond. I have fought with spear and shield, sword and armour and finally destroyed Gywn as a somersaulting ninja with a two handed halberd. Few games allow for such varied gameplay and such a detailed environment.

Dark Souls 2 sits now tempting me to start but no matter how great a concept the game is the point is that a goal has been reached and there are other goals apart from completing a game. So time to celebrate and say goodbye to Dark Souls
